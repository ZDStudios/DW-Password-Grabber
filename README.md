# DW-Password-Grabber
DW stands for Discord Webhook. This is a Windows batch file, created with my assistance and a little help from Copilot, that can retrieve Chrome and Edge passwords (which are currently encrypted; I'm working on an automatic decryption tool). Please use it responsibly and for legal purposes only, but have fun!


 On line 31 replace the webhook_url with you discord webhook
